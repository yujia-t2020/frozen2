<p> Why was Elsa born with magical powers? The answer is calling her and threatening her kingdom. Together with Anna, Kristoff, Olaf and Sven, she'll set out on a dangerous but remarkable journey. In “Frozen,” Elsa feared her powers were too much for the world. In “Frozen 2,” she must hope they are enough. From the Academy Award®-winning team—directors Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck, producer Peter Del Vecho and songwriters Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez—and featuring the voices of Idina Menzel, Kristen Bell, Jonathan Groff and Josh Gad, Walt Disney Animation Studios’ “Frozen 2” opens in U.S. theaters on Nov. 22, 2019.

Set three years after the original, Elsa is haunted by a mysterious siren call that only she can hear. Shortly after she starts hearing the voice, unrest erupts in the kingdom. So, she follows the voice into a forest encapsulated by a magic fog, in search of an answer. No one has ever been able to go in or out before, until Elsa, thanks to her magical powers. Anna, Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) and Olaf (Josh Gad), join Elsa on her quest into the unknown land to save their kingdom. </p>
